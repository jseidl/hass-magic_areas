# Magic Areas for Home Assistant: Your areas so smart it's almost magic! ü™Ñ

![ma-logo]

Magic Areas is a Home Assistant custom integration that brings context-aware, state-driven automation to your smart home.

Instead of configuring each entity manually, Magic Areas leverages **areas**, **meta-areas**, and **presence sensing** to create smart groups and advanced automations. It turns Home Assistant's built-in Areas into **intelligent, presence-aware zones**, automatically detecting when someone is in a room ‚Äî and when they‚Äôve left ‚Äî using your existing motion, presence, or occupancy sensors.

Magic Areas intelligently tracks presence and adds powerful automations like light control, fan activation, and climate presets ‚Äî all managed through a clean UI.

Smart areas that just works, everytime, out of the box. Fully customizable if you want it.

### Download and install through [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the Adaptive Lighting integration inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jseidl&repository=magic-areas&category=integration)

## ‚ú® What Magic Areas Does

* Detects presence in each area using multiple sources (motion sensors, media players, device trackers, BLE beacons, and more).
* Creates smart groups (lights, fans, climate, media players) that respond to an area‚Äôs state automatically.
* Supports secondary states like dark, sleep, and extended for context-aware automation.
* Provides meta-areas (e.g., Interior, Exterior, Global, Floors) to coordinate multiple areas at once.
* Includes built-in, automation-like features: light control, fan groups, climate preset switching, and more

> [!NOTE]
> Check out our [magic concepts on our documentation](https://magicareas.io/concepts/).

## Features

### Presence
* **üï∞Ô∏è Smart Presence Timeouts:** Each area has a configurable timeout for clearing presence after the last motion. If motion is detected again within the timeout, it resets ‚Äî no abrupt shutoffs.
* **‚úã Presence Hold:** Creates a switch to manually override presence in an area. Useful if sensors aren‚Äôt fully reliable yet or for guests.
* **üïØÔ∏è Secondary States:** Define subtle room states for more nuanced automations:
    * `dark` / `bright`: Based on light sensors or sun
    * `sleep`: Tracked by any entity
    * `extended`: When a room has been occupied beyond a set time
    * `accented`: Track presence based on entertainment like media players
* **üè† Meta-Areas and Hierarchies:** Set areas as **interior**, **exterior** and assign them to **floors**. Magic Areas will create meta-areas to track grouped presence (e.g., upstairs occupied). Presence logic and secondary states are inherited and calculated automatically.

### Smart Control
* **üí° Smart Light Groups**: Automatically groups your lights by purpose ‚Äî overhead, task, accent, and sleep ‚Äî and controls them based on presence state. Lights can be set to trigger only in the dark or after extended occupancy.
* **üå°Ô∏è Climate Control:** Map area states to climate device presets. For example: set your HVAC to `eco` when empty, and back to `comfort` when occupied or in sleep mode.
* **üß† Wasp in a Box:** Reliable presence sensing that accounts for people entering/leaving rooms with doors. Combines motion and door/garage sensors to prevent lights from turning off while you‚Äôre still inside.
* **üî• Fan Groups:** Auto-creates a `fan` group entity for each area and lets you control it using an aggregated value like temperature, humidity, or CO‚ÇÇ. Great for exhaust fans, ceiling fans, or air quality fans.
* **üì∂ Area-Aware Media Player:** Play media (like TTS alerts) only in rooms that are currently occupied. Forward notifications to the right areas ‚Äî not empty ones.
* **üßÆ Sensor Aggregates:** Aggregates all `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities in the area by `device_class` and `unit_of_measurement`. Great for dashboards, alerts, and logic.
* **üö® Health Sensor:** Auto-aggregated binary sensors for safety-related device classes:
    * `gas`, `smoke`, `moisture` (leaks), `problem`, `safety`
* **üì° BLE Tracker Integration:** Track text-based BLE sensors (like ESPresense, Bermuda, or Room Assistant) directly. Magic Areas will convert their values into usable presence sensors automatically.
