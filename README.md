# Magic Areas for Home Assistant: Your areas so smart it's almost magic! 🪄

![ma-logo]

Magic Areas is a Home Assistant custom integration that brings context-aware, state-driven automation to your smart home.

Instead of configuring each entity manually, Magic Areas leverages **areas**, **meta-areas**, and **presence sensing** to create smart groups and advanced automations. It turns Home Assistant's built-in Areas into **intelligent, presence-aware zones**, automatically detecting when someone is in a room — and when they’ve left — using your existing motion, presence, or occupancy sensors.

Magic Areas intelligently tracks presence and adds powerful automations like light control, fan activation, and climate presets — all managed through a clean UI.

Smart areas that just works, everytime, out of the box. Fully customizable if you want it.

### Download and install through [HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)](https://hacs.xyz/):

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open the Adaptive Lighting integration inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=jseidl&repository=magic-areas&category=integration)

## ✨ What Magic Areas Does

* Detects presence in each area using multiple sources (motion sensors, media players, device trackers, BLE beacons, and more).
* Creates smart groups (lights, fans, climate, media players) that respond to an area’s state automatically.
* Supports secondary states like dark, sleep, and extended for context-aware automation.
* Provides meta-areas (e.g., Interior, Exterior, Global, Floors) to coordinate multiple areas at once.
* Includes built-in, automation-like features: light control, fan groups, climate preset switching, and more

> [!NOTE]
> Check out our [magic concepts on our documentation](https://magicareas.io/concepts/).

## Features

### Presence
* **🕰️ Smart Presence Timeouts:** Each area has a configurable timeout for clearing presence after the last motion. If motion is detected again within the timeout, it resets — no abrupt shutoffs.
* **✋ Presence Hold:** Creates a switch to manually override presence in an area. Useful if sensors aren’t fully reliable yet or for guests.
* **🕯️ Secondary States:** Define subtle room states for more nuanced automations:
    * `dark` / `bright`: Based on light sensors or sun
    * `sleep`: Tracked by any entity
    * `extended`: When a room has been occupied beyond a set time
    * `accented`: Track presence based on entertainment like media players
* **🏠 Meta-Areas and Hierarchies:** Set areas as **interior**, **exterior** and assign them to **floors**. Magic Areas will create meta-areas to track grouped presence (e.g., upstairs occupied). Presence logic and secondary states are inherited and calculated automatically.

### Smart Control
* **💡 Smart Light Groups**: Automatically groups your lights by purpose — overhead, task, accent, and sleep — and controls them based on presence state. Lights can be set to trigger only in the dark or after extended occupancy.
* **🌡️ Climate Control:** Map area states to climate device presets. For example: set your HVAC to `eco` when empty, and back to `comfort` when occupied or in sleep mode.
* **🧠 Wasp in a Box:** Reliable presence sensing that accounts for people entering/leaving rooms with doors. Combines motion and door/garage sensors to prevent lights from turning off while you’re still inside.
* **🔥 Fan Groups:** Auto-creates a `fan` group entity for each area and lets you control it using an aggregated value like temperature, humidity, or CO₂. Great for exhaust fans, ceiling fans, or air quality fans.
* **📶 Area-Aware Media Player:** Play media (like TTS alerts) only in rooms that are currently occupied. Forward notifications to the right areas — not empty ones.
* **🧮 Sensor Aggregates:** Aggregates all `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities in the area by `device_class` and `unit_of_measurement`. Great for dashboards, alerts, and logic.
* **🚨 Health Sensor:** Auto-aggregated binary sensors for safety-related device classes:
    * `gas`, `smoke`, `moisture` (leaks), `problem`, `safety`
* **📡 BLE Tracker Integration:** Track text-based BLE sensors (like ESPresense, Bermuda, or Room Assistant) directly. Magic Areas will convert their values into usable presence sensors automatically.
