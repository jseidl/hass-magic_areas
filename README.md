# Magic Areas for Home Assistant
> Your areas so smart it's almost magic! 🪄

Ever had your lights turn off while you're still in the room?

**Magic Areas** fixes that. It turns Home Assistant's built-in Areas into **intelligent, presence-aware zones**, automatically detecting when someone is in a room — and when they’ve left — using your existing motion, presence, or occupancy sensors.

No more motion-only logic that fails when you sit still. Magic Areas intelligently tracks presence and adds powerful automations like light control, fan activation, and climate presets — all managed through a clean UI.

Works out of the box. Fully customizable if you want it.

## How It Works

* Detects sensors in your areas automatically (motion, presence, BLE, etc.)
* Tracks room presence with a smart `area_state` sensor
* Adds secondary states like `bright`/`dark`, `sleep`, and `extended`
* Includes built-in, automation-like features: light control, fan groups, climate preset switching, and more
* Fully configurable through the UI

## Features

### 💡 Smart Light Groups

Automatically groups your lights by purpose — overhead, task, accent, and sleep — and controls them based on presence state. Lights can be set to trigger only in the dark or after extended occupancy.

➡️ Group `light` entities like `Kitchen Overhead Lights`, `Bedroom Accent Lights`

### 🌡️ Climate Control

Map area states to climate device presets. For example: set your HVAC to `eco` when empty, and back to `comfort` when occupied or in sleep mode.

➡️ Works best in meta-areas like Interior or Floor

### 🧠 Wasp in a Box

Reliable presence sensing that accounts for people entering/leaving rooms with doors. Combines motion and door/garage sensors to prevent lights from turning off while you’re still inside.

### 🕰️ Smart Presence Timeouts

Each area has a configurable timeout for clearing presence after the last motion. If motion is detected again within the timeout, it resets — no abrupt shutoffs.

### 🕯️ Secondary States

Define subtle room states for more nuanced automations:

* `dark` / `bright`: Based on light sensors or sun
* `sleep`: Tracked by any entity
* `extended`: When a room has been occupied beyond a set time
* `accented`: Track presence based on entertainment like media players

### 🔥 Fan Groups

Auto-creates a `fan` group entity for each area and lets you control it using an aggregated value like temperature, humidity, or CO₂. Great for exhaust fans, ceiling fans, or air quality fans.

### 📶 Area-Aware Media Player

Play media (like TTS alerts) only in rooms that are currently occupied. Forward notifications to the right areas — not empty ones.

➡️ Configurable per area: pick devices, states, and behavior

### 🧮 Sensor Aggregates

Aggregates all `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities in the area by `device_class` and `unit_of_measurement`. Great for dashboards, alerts, and logic.

➡️ Auto-generates `sensor.area_temperature` or `binary_sensor.area_motion` style entities

### 🚨 Health Sensors

Auto-aggregated binary sensors for safety-related device classes:

* `gas`, `smoke`, `moisture` (leaks), `problem`, `safety`

➡️ Works in all areas including meta-areas

### ✋ Presence Hold

Creates a switch to manually override presence in an area. Useful if sensors aren’t fully reliable yet or for guests. 📖 [Learn more](https://github.com/jseidl/hass-magic_areas/wiki/Presence-Hold)

➡️ Optional timeout to reset the hold automatically

### 📡 BLE Tracker Integration

Track text-based BLE sensors (like ESPresense, Bermuda, or Room Assistant) directly. Magic Areas will convert their values into usable presence sensors automatically.

### 🏠 Meta-Areas and Hierarchies

Tag areas as **interior**, **exterior**, or assign them to **floors**. Magic Areas will create meta-areas to track grouped presence (e.g., upstairs occupied). Presence logic and secondary states are inherited and calculated automatically.
