Tired of writing the same automations, over and over, for each of your rooms? You wish Home Assistant just figured out all entities you have in an area and **magically** started being smarter about them? 

Magic Areas is the batteries that were missing! Would like to have a single `motion` sensor that is grouped to all your other motion sensors in that area? What if all (most) of your `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities had aggregates (grouping/average), PER AREA? Would you like for lights and climate devices to turn on and off **MAGICALLY** whenever an area is occupied/clear?

If you think all of the above features are freaking awesome, **Magic Areas** is here for you!
