## 🎨 Community Showcase

We love seeing what the community builds with Magic Areas! Here are a few projects to inspire you:

- **[Linus Dashboard](https://github.com/Thank-you-Linus/Linus-Dashboard)** – a plug-and-play, auto-organized UI for Home Assistant that keeps itself tidy while you keep living your life. Plays nicely with meta-areas (Global / Interior / Exterior) and aggregates entities and provides a coherent structure out of the box for Magic Areas-centric homes.
