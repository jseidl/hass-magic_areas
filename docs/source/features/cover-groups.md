# 🪟 Cover Groups

The **Cover Groups** feature automatically creates a [cover group](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover.group/) in Home Assistant for each area, grouping all the `cover` entities assigned to that area. This allows you to control multiple covers—such as blinds, shutters, or garage doors—using a single entity.

!!! warning
    ⚠️ If an area has no `cover` entities, no group will be created.

This makes it easier to control multiple covers—such as blinds, shutters, or garage doors—in a single area using just one entity.

## 🛠️ Example Automations

### 🔆 Open all window shades in the morning
```yaml
alias: Open All Shades at Sunrise
trigger:
  - platform: sun
    event: sunrise
action:
  - service: cover.open_cover
    target:
      entity_id:
        - cover.living_room
        - cover.bedroom
        - cover.kitchen
mode: single
```

!!! info
    Each `cover.` entity here refers to the **automatically created area group**, such as `cover.living_room` if your living room has covers. The actual `entity_id` generated by Magic Areas are much larger to prevent conflicts. You can find the specific `entity_id` via the UI on the entity's properties.

### 🚘 Close all garage doors at night
```yaml
alias: Close All Garage Doors at Night
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: "22:00:00"
action:
  - service: cover.close_cover
    target:
      entity_id:
        - cover.garage
        - cover.workshop
mode: single
```

> Helpful for ensuring all covers tagged as garage doors are closed before bed or when leaving the house.
