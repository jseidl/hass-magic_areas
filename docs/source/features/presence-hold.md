# Presence Hold

The **Presence Hold** üîí feature creates a dedicated [switch](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/switch/) for an area that acts as a **manual override presence sensor**.

This allows you to **force the area‚Äôs presence state to `occupied`** by toggling the switch on, regardless of other presence detections.


## ‚è≥ Timeout Option

You can configure an optional **timeout (in seconds)** after which the switch will automatically turn `off`, releasing the override and allowing presence detection to resume normally.

## Use Cases

- Manually mark a room as occupied even if presence sensors don‚Äôt detect anyone (e.g., pets, guests)
- Keep an area ‚Äúoccupied‚Äù temporarily for testing automations or events
- Override presence during unusual circumstances like maintenance or cleaning

## How It Works

- Turning the Presence Hold switch **`on`** forces the area presence to `occupied`
- When **`off`**, presence detection behaves normally based on configured sensors and logic
- If a `timeout` is set, the switch automatically turns off after the timeout period

Simple and powerful, Presence Hold gives you manual control over presence states whenever you need it.
