# 🪄 Magic Areas for Home Assistant

Welcome to the **Magic Areas** documentation!
Magic Areas is a [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) custom integration that brings **context-aware, state-driven automation** to your smart home.

Instead of configuring each entity manually, Magic Areas leverages **areas**, **meta-areas**, and **presence sensing** to create smart groups and advanced automations — with **zero YAML required**.

---

## ✨ What Magic Areas Does

* Detects **presence** in each area using multiple sources (motion sensors, media players, device trackers, BLE beacons, and more).
* Creates **smart groups** (lights, fans, climate, media players) that respond to an area’s state automatically.
* Supports **secondary states** like `dark`, `sleep`, and `extended` for context-aware automation.
* Provides **meta-areas** (e.g., *Interior*, *Exterior*, *Global*, *Floors*) to coordinate multiple areas at once.
* Adds **advanced features** like:
    * 💡 Automatic Light Control
    * 🌡️ Automatic Climate Control
    * 📊 Aggregation sensors
    * 🛡️ Area health monitoring
    * 🎶 Area-aware media routing
    * 🐝 Wasp-in-a-box logic
    * ⏱️ Presence hold switches
    * 🛰️ BLE tracker support
